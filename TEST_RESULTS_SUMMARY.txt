=== ALL TEST RESULTS ===

1. Unit Tests - User-Agent Matching (test_robots_ua_priority)
✓ googlebot/1.2 -> googlebot
✓ bingbot* -> bingbot
✓ crawler -> crawler
✓ test/agent/1.0 -> test
✓ Exact match: googlebot == googlebot
✓ Wildcard match: * matches any-bot
✓ Version handling: googlebot/1.2 matches googlebot/2.0
✓ Case-insensitive: GoogleBot matches googlebot
✓ Non-matching: googlebot != bingbot
✓ Parsed 2 rule groups
✓ Googlebot rule has specificity 3 (exact match)
✓ Wildcard rule has specificity 1
✓ Allow directive parsed
✓ /private/public in allows list
✓ /private in disallows list
✓ Parsed 3 rule groups
✓ First testbot rule has specificity 3
✓ Second testbot rule has specificity 3
✓ Googlebot disallows /admin
✓ Wildcard disallows /secret
✓ Root disallow parsed
RESULTS: 21 tests passed, 0 failed
✓ All tests passed!

2. Integration Tests (test_robots_integration)
✓ Parsed 2 rule groups
✓ Googlebot rule has higher specificity
✓ Parsed 3 rule groups (2 googlebot + 1 wildcard)
✓ Specificity levels correct
✓ Both googlebot rule groups parsed correctly
✓ Complex paths parsed correctly
✓ Individual paths stored correctly
✓ Case-insensitive matching works
✓ Different agents don't match
✓ Empty Disallow parsed
✓ Version suffix ignored in matching
✓ Different versions match same normalized agent
✓ Root disallow (/) parsed correctly
✓ Asterisk suffix removed from user-agent
✓ crawler* matches crawler
✓ Wildcard fallback logic correct
RESULTS: 16 tests passed, 0 failed
✓ All integration tests passed!

3. Wildcard Path Matching Tests (test_robots_wildcard)
✓ /fish matches /fish
✓ /fish matches /fishheads
✓ /fish matches /fish.html
✓ /fish also matches /fish/ (prefix)
✓ /fish does NOT match /catfish
✓ /$  matches /
✓ /$  does NOT match /test
✓ /$  does NOT match /test/
✓ /*.php matches /index.php
✓ /*.php matches /dir/index.php

✓ /fish*.php matches /fish123.php
✓ /fish*.php matches /fishheads.php
✓ /fish*.php does NOT match /catfish.php
✓ /fish*.php does NOT match /fish.html
✓ Longest match /admin allowed when both / and /admin apply
✓ Disallow / when no longer allow applies
✓ Allow wins over Disallow when equal length
✓ /fish/ matches /fish/salmon.html
✓ /fish/ does NOT match /fish
✓ /fish/ does NOT match /fish.html
✓ /*.php* matches /index.php
